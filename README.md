This repository contain all traffic simulation code used to develop the paper **"MODELAGEM FUZZY PARA O PROBLEMA DE TEMPORIZAÇÃO SEMAFÓRICA EM INTERSEÇÕES DE QUATRO TEMPOS"** on Abakós Journal.

This code uses as base an original example project from SUMO developers, so it is expected language mixing and maybe useless code.

The paper is avaiable only in _portuguese_ at http://periodicos.pucminas.br/index.php/abakos/article/view/P.2316-9451.2014v3n1p59 DOI - 10.5752/P.2316-9451.2014V3N1P59

To run this project, at the command line use
```python
python runner.py # this one will generate cross.rou.xml in runtime
```

The result will be avaiable in **tripinfo.xml**
